# InstagramDownloader
InstagramDownloader is an application that lets you download a user's whole profile, stories, and highlights from Instagram
- Public accounts can be downloaded.
- A private account can only be downloaded if you have followed the target successfully.
- Simply copy-paste the username of the Instagram account in the application (Multiple users download is accepted)

Three different applications are included
- Instagram Profile Downloader (login required if a private account is going to be downloaded)
- Instagram Highlights Downloader (log-in required)
- Instagram Stories Downloader (login required)

#Instagram Highlights Downloader (Highlights)
- Log into the Instagram account on the Firefox browser is required before running the automated application

#Instagram Stories Downloader (Stories)
- Log into the Instagram account on the Firefox browser is required before running the automated application

Since Instagram has been continually updating its algorithms and implementing measures to identify and prevent automated activities,
therefore, I have been trying my best to optimize the application for account suspension, restriction of features, or even permanent banning.
